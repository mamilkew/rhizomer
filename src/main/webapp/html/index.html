<h1 style="text-align: left;">Rhizomer</h1>
<p>Rhizomer is a web application that facilitates publishing and also exploration of Semantic Web data (and particularly Linked Data).</p>
<p>With Rhizomer, lay users can explore datasets performing the 3 basic data analysis tasks proposed by Shneiderman:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li><b>Overview</b>: <em>get the full picture of the data set at hand</em>. <br />
    Rhizomer applies the Global Navigation interaction pattern implemented as <strong>navigation bars</strong> (at the top), automatically generated from the <strong>ontologies and taxonomies</strong> structuring the dataset.</li>
    <li><b>Zoom &amp; Filter</b>: <em>zoom in on items of interest and filter out uninteresting      items</em>.<br />
    The choice in this case is Faceted Navigation.      Once we have zoomed by selecting the kind of things we are interested in      from the navigation bar, <strong>facets</strong> help users filter out those that are not interesting. Facets are also generated automatically.</li>
    <li><b>Details</b>: <em>after zooming and filtering the user arrives to the concrete      resources of interest</em>. <br />
    At this point, the user can get the details for      those resources. This is&nbsp;implemented as a <strong>list of properties      and values</strong>&nbsp;plus <strong>plugable specific visualisations</strong> tailored to the kind of resource at hand, e.g. a map for geo-located      resources.</li>
</ul>
